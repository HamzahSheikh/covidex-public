# Covidex

## About the Project

Covidex is a covid-19 tracking application designed for multiple users such as common patients, doctors, health officials and and immigration officials. Its goal is to help us deal with the reality of the situation we currently face and try to move forward. Patients would be able to upload their health status details onto the platform. This in turn would be monitored by both doctors and health officials to both help the patients as well as track the progress of the virus. We would be able to monitor daily cases and get a better understanding of how the virus is changing to help mitigate the risks for the rest of the population.
